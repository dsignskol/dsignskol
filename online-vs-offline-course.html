          <p>It's time to consider which type of educational platform fits your lifestyle: traditional classroom or online. Here's some information on both options to help guide your decision in selecting an online or a traditional classroom degree program.</p>

          <h3>Physical Attendance Versus an Online Learning Environment</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The traditional classroom education experience requires you to attend classes in person and on campus—still the most common way of learning,</li>
            <li>Virtual learning environment are accessed via the Internet so you can participate from home with a flexible schedule. Online education platforms are increasingly becoming an appealing option for many students.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Before you choose, consider the benefits of each type and which best reflects your lifestyle.</p>

          <h3>Traditional Classroom Can Offer Extra Appeal to the Senses</h3>
          <p>A powerful advantage of traditional classroom learning is its multi-sensory appeal. You can listen to an instructor, participate in face-to-face group discussions, and ask questions along the way. If you struggle to focus, the exchange of dialogue that exists in a classroom setting can help you stay engaged and retain knowledge.</p>
          <p>In addition, the sense of community and face-to-face interaction experienced in the classroom can help you build personal and professional relationships with peers and faculty. You may find the connections you make in class to be significant resources throughout your studies and later on in your career.</p>

          <h3>Online Programs Can Provide Greater Convenience in Comparison to a Traditional Classroom Schedule</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Traditional classroom education can be  very structured, and requires the student to learn at a designated place and time. For some, this structure keeps them on track. But for others, sticking to an organized agenda is difficult, especially if they are balancing work or family responsibilities on top of their studies.</li>
            <li>The convenience and flexibility of online learning enables you to study virtually any time, anywhere you have an Internet connection. It's an ideal solution for people with demanding work schedules or family obligations. A virtual learning environment is also great for students who prefer to learn at their own pace. In many situations, you can pause the content or go back to a portion to refresh your memory. This is incredibly helpful when you need to spend extra time on a challenging topic.</li>
