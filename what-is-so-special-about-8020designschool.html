          <p>There are around 50K car models across the world. But to a skilled driver it is just a car. He will be able to drive any car seamlessly if he is an expert driver. He is always called a “Driver” and not “Toyotta Driver”or “Audi Driver”. Whatever the car is, it is going to contain the same motor, steering, brakes and seats. It is always the skills that matter. Similarly for everything the concept is going to be the same when there would be advancements in the tools used for that. Likewise, there are around 1000+ photo editing tools from Adobe Photoshop to Coreldraw to number of apps in Google Store. But still the concept of design remains the same. If you can learn the design basics strongly, you can excel in any tool. 8020 Design School commit to teach you the design concepts using which you can master any tool.</p>

          <p>A beginner can learn the Adobe Photoshop tools in around a week’s time. That is why a Photoshop expert is different from a Design Expert. Not all Photoshop experts are Design Experts. Design experts know how a design works rather than just how a tool works in Photoshop.</p>

          <p>How much does a real Design course costs? It is very similar to ask how much a Dad charges to teach his kid how to ride a bicycle.  But still a Dad has to invest for the bicycle and his time. Likewise, we have to invest in the space for classrooms, systems and tools. The fees you pay majorly covers the accessories and a part goes as the salary.</p>
